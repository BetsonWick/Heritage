The time you find the inner self -
Thou start to live the life.
You leave the mold and form due wealth
As well as filthy strife.

Ongoing orders from the crowd
Initiate a shift,
As most obey, contrasting loud
The man emerges swift.

That person struggles as a heart
Supporting corpse to stay,
His iron will becomes his guard -
He always seeks the way.

No other methods he confides,
Not genuine enough;
The other deeds make him confined,
His path is what is tough.
